## üìÅ Dataset Description: EuroSAT

- *Dataset*: [EuroSAT Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apollo2506/eurosat-dataset)
- *Description*: This dataset contains **27,000+ RGB satellite images** classified into **10 land use and land cover categories** such as Forest, Residential, River, etc. It is widely used for **remote sensing** and **land classification** tasks.

## üìí Jupyter Notebooks

All experiments and models are documented in **Jupyter Notebooks**, which are organized based on different **SSL models** (SimCLR, BYOL, MoCo v2) and **CNN backbones** (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B3). These notebooks contain the following:

- **Model Training**: Implementation and evaluation of the models with different hyperparameters.
- **Learning Curves**: Accuracy and loss curves for each model architecture and epoch configuration (100, 300, 400, 500).
- **Performance Metrics**: Model evaluation using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- **Grad-CAM Visualizations**: To visualize the model's focus on key features for accurate classifications.
